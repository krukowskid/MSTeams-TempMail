# MSTeams-TempMail
Pretty easy solution for temporary / disposable mailbox on Microsoft Teams channel.

I had to create private temporary email solution for dev/test environments. Our testers were using portals like getnada but we wanted to keep all emails private. There are some "self-hosted" solutions, but they require server to run and don't have built-in authentication capability. This solution is using Exchange Online (but it could be any mail server).
